## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** React, JavaScript, HTML, CSS

This navigation bar was developed using React. I call this navigation bar dynamic as the items in the nav bar as well as the social media icons will populate according the to number of items in the data. When the nav bar is viewed on mobile devices, it collapses and opens up into a menu who's height will dynamically adjust according to the number of items in the list. Any change to the nav bar content needs to be made in the data file and the bar will adjust automatically.
